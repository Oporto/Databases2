# Databases2

Team: Pedro De Vasconcellos Oporto and Katherine Thompson

Follow set up instructions provided for class (we used the IntelliJ instructions)
When you start you must run StartUp, then run CreateStudentDB, finally Examples (in studentClient->simpleDB) can be run for some testing based on the tables created in CreateStudentDB.
You will need to StartUp each time you want to run. If you run and there is a BufferUnderflowException you will need to go to your personnal User folder on your computer and clear out (delete the files in) the cs4432DB folder and then run StartUp and CreateStudentDB again.
test_phase1 folder includes testing for this project, and a testing file that will produce testing output for our changes to simpleDB.

Finally in the Phase1 folder the original README.txt for simpleDB can be found, please refer to that with any additional questions.
