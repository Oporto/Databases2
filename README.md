Team: Pedro De Vasconcellos Oporto and Katherine Thompson

Follow set up instructions provided for class (we used the IntelliJ instructions)
When you start you must run StartUp, then run CreateStudentDB, finally Examples (in studentClient->simpleDB) can be run for some testing based on the tables created in CreateStudentDB for Task 1. These outputs can be found in ExamplesOutput.
You will need to StartUp each time you want to run, and will need to create the table with CreateStudentDB. If you run and there is a BufferUnderflowException you will need to go to your personnal User folder on your computer and clear out (delete the files in) the cs4432DB folder and then run StartUp and CreateStudentDB again.
test_phase1 folder includes testing for this project, and a testing file that will produce testing output for our changes to simpleDB. Additionally we have provided a testing output file.

In our zip you will find a zip of simpleDB with our code (within which is Examples.java which was mentioned above), design.txt, testing.txt, and bugs.txt

Finally in the Phase1 folder the original README.txt for simpleDB can be found, please refer to that with any additional questions that go beyond our additions to simpleDB
